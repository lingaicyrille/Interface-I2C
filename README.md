# I2C (Inter- Integrated Circuit)
In thid project we will work on I2C, short for Inter-Integrated Circuit, serves as a serial communication protocol facilitating interaction among multiple integrated circuits or chips either within a single device or across devices. Originally developed by Philips, now NXP Semiconductors, this protocol finds widespread use in connecting sensors, memory devices, actuators, and other peripherals within embedded systems. I2C relies on two wires for communication: the Serial Data Line (SDA) for carrying data and the Serial Clock Line (SCL) for transmitting clock signals. Operating in a master-slave architecture, I2C involves a master device initiating and overseeing communication, while one or more slave devices respond to the master's commands. Each device on the I2C bus possesses a unique address. The master specifies the address of the intended slave device during data transmission. The SDA line enables bidirectional communication, allowing both the master and the slave to send and receive data. SCL, the clock signal, is generated by the master, serving as the synchronization mechanism for data transfer between devices. I2C accommodates multi-master configurations, permitting multiple master devices to communicate on the same bus. Mechanisms exist for resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple masters seek access simultaneously. I2C supports various data rates, including standard mode (100 kbit/s), fast mode (400 kbit/s), and high-speed mode (1 Mbit/s). I used two Explorer 18 boards then, I Loaded the I2C Slave code into one of them. I2C interface between two uControllers. I modified the master firmware so it read the temperature from the slave and displays it on the LCD. I modified the master firmware so it read the pressure from the slave and displays it on the LCD. I modified the master firmware to write a new value to the slaveâ€™s Sample Rate register.
